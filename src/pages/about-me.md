## My Beginnings in Programming üñ•Ô∏è

In 2018, I entered high school and decided to get computer and digital sciences as an option. This introduction to programming was my first contact with the world of technology. With the help of my teacher, I learned the basics of **Python** and **C**. We created small projects like mathematical representations and a simple game.

The following year I chose Digital and Computer Sciences as my major and continued learning programming. I started creating small projects, such as a **Sudoku solver** and a **crypographic decoder**. I also learned about **algorithms**, **data structures** and **networks**.

## Deep Dive into the Low Levels ü§ñ

After high school, I enrolled in the **Saint-√âtienne Initial IT Training Cycle (CITISE)** at **T√©l√©com Saint-√âtienne**, where I truly began to understand what lies beneath the user interfaces and high-level abstractions. This intensive preparatory program gave me a solid foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computing and engineering.

### Theoretical Foundations üìö

Throughout the program, I strengthened my understanding of the **mathematics** behind computer science. These concepts were deeply intertwined with the **physics** I studied which later helped me grasp the physical principles behind electronic components and signal processing.

### Electronics, Embedded Systems and Networks ‚ö°

One of the most important parts of CITISE was diving into **electronics**, **embedded programming** and **networks**. I learned how to work with **microcontrollers**, write low-level code in **C**, and manipulate sensors to build interactive systems.

As we progressed, I explored more complex computer science topics. I learned the fundamentals of **computer networks**, both in theory and in practice, which opened my eyes to the invisible infrastructure behind the web and modern communication systems.

### Applied Projects and Real-World Experience üí°

CITISE placed a strong emphasis on **projects**, where I got to apply what I was learning in a collaborative setting. Some of the highlights included:

- A **bibliographic research project** on **the formation of the green ray**, which taught me how to dig deep into technical literature.
- A full **C# software project**, which taught me how to manage a codebase, structure an application, and collaborate with others. In a group of three, we developed a **Spotify playlist analyzer** that could analyze and visualize the characteristics of playlists, such as genre distribution, tempo, and more.
- Finally, I completed a **professional internship**, where I had the opportunity to put my skills into practice in a real-world environment. I worked on a project to develop a **web application** to command a 3-axis sample-holder for a **measurement and control system for production lines**.

## Becoming a DevOps Engineer üöÄ

In 2022, I graduated from CITISE and joined **Polytech Montpellier** to pursue an **Engineering degree** with a specialization in **Development and Operations (DO)**. This 3-year program combines academic learning with real-world experience through an **apprenticeship format**, allowing me to work in a company for half of my time while studying.

### Learning by Doing üõ†Ô∏è

The DO program is strongly project-based and designed to mirror industry practices. From the start, I was immersed in team-oriented projects covering the entire **DevOps lifecycle**: from **design**, **development**, and **testing**, to **integration**, **deployment**, **monitoring**, **scaling**, and **evolution** of applications ‚Äî both **on-premises** and in the **cloud**.

### Immersed in Industry üè¢

As an **apprentice**, I alternated between **two weeks in the company** and **two weeks at school**, applying what I learned in a real DevOps team. This rhythm helps me stay aligned with the evolving needs of the industry, taking part in both **short-term tasks** and **long-term strategic projects**.

### Professional Exposure and Events üåç

Throughout the program, I had opportunities to attend conferences such as **KubeCon Europe** in London, as well as national tech events in **Marseille**, **Montpellier** and beyond.

I also took part in **hackathons**, and I am currently preparing myself for the **CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator)** certification.

## International Experience üåé

In 2025, I had the incredible opportunity to work as an intern at **SDU** in **Denmark**. This experience allowed me to immerse myself in a different culture, learn from a new team, and apply my skills in an international context. I worked on an **AI** focused project, where I collaborated with colleagues from diverse backgrounds, to develop a new LLM (Large Language Model) application that could be used to detect and help as a personal assistant for people with breast cancer.

## Event Organization üéâ

In 2024‚Äì2025, I had the opportunity to **lead the organization of the PolyCloud Montpellier** as the **president of the student association** behind the event. It was an incredibly rewarding experience where I worked closely with my classmates to bring together students, professionals, and cloud computing enthusiasts for a full day of knowledge sharing and networking.

From the ground up, we planned the entire event ‚Äî inviting speakers from various companies and universities, securing sponsors, and handling all logistical aspects. This experience allowed me to put my **project management and organizational skills** into practice while building meaningful connections within the tech and cloud ecosystem.
