**Beep** is a project over 3 years in the making, inspired by Discord's design and functionality. It aims to provide a modern, user-friendly interface for real-time communication, focusing on simplicity and performance.
Developed with **React** and styled using **TailwindCSS**, Beep is designed to be modular, responsive, and easy to navigate. It incorporates real-time messaging features, user authentication and all the core functionalities of a modern chat application.

The goal of the application was to have a project for the duration of my college years, as a group of 15.

We managed the entire project, from the initial design on Figma to the final deployment with a concrete CI/CD.
